## Rapid Editor Privacy Policy

The Rapid editor privacy policy (https://mapwith.ai/doc/license/MapWithAIPrivacyPolicy.pdf) contains all the up-to-date information about use of the Rapid editor.
### Source code and website ([https://mapwith.ai](https://mapwith.ai/))

If you choose to interact with the project GitHub page or website hosted by GitHub, you do so in accordance with [GitHub’s Privacy Policy](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-privacy-statement). If you choose any other communications medium to contact the maintainers of Rapid, that use is governed by the policies of those respective mediums. See [https://github.com/facebook/Rapid](https://github.com/facebook/Rapid) for more information. Rapid may use any feedback you provide.

### Cookies

Rapid uses cookies, website logs and other similar data and technologies (i) to preserve information so you will not have to re-enter or re-encounter it during your visit or on subsequent visits; (ii) to maintain sessions for authenticated users; (iii) to monitor metrics about use such as the number of visitors and most used features; (iv) for internal diagnostic and analytic purposes (v) to improve the editor and related features, and (vi) to provide information to you about Rapid, editing, or OpenStreetMap. We have a legitimate interest in improving and informing you about Rapid, and certain data collection is necessary in order for Rapid to function. You may delete cookies from your computer, and most browsers provide the option to block cookies. However, if you block cookies, portions of Rapid may not work as intended. For example, you must be logged into your OpenStreetMap account in order to edit OpenStreetMap.

### Logging into OpenStreetMap

In order to make edits using Rapid, you must be logged into your OpenStreetMap account. You may do so via the OpenStreetMap website or a number of third-party login services. That use is governed by the respective privacy policies of the login method you choose.

### Changeset information

When you use Rapid to edit OpenStreetMap, Rapid uses the OpenStreetMap API to contribute edits. For quality control purposes, along with the information typically recorded for an OpenStreetMap edit, Rapid automatically adds tags to each changeset submitted with Rapid which identifies the changeset as one made with Rapid and information that indicates the user’s level of experience with Rapid editor and/or its walkthrough. See [here](https://github.com/facebook/Rapid/blob/release/modules/ui/commit.js) for details. The [OSMF privacy policy](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy) governs the use of this data in the OpenStreetMap database.

### Editor experience tags

Details on that are [here](https://github.com/facebook/Rapid/blob/release/modules/ui/commit.js).

### Background imagery and other third party services

If you use background or streetside imagery to aid your edits, your browser must fetch information and images from a third-party imagery host. That use is governed by the respective privacy policies of each imagery host. The [Editor Layer Index](https://github.com/osmlab/editor-layer-index) and [Rapid Editor GitHub code](https://github.com/facebook/Rapid/blob/release/modules/ui/map_data.js) provides detailed information as to imagery layers available in Rapid. In addition, you may use third party services to assist your editing or check for errors. If you do not wish to interact with these third parties, do not use these features.

### Name Suggestion Index

The Name Suggestion Index is a feature in Rapid to aid users in consistently and accurately identifying the brand names of companies on the map. The NSI optionally fetches information and brand logos hosted on third party websites, including WikiData, Wikimedia Commons, and the brands’ respective Facebook and Twitter accounts. That use is governed by their respective privacy policies, including [https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy); [https://twitter.com/en/privacy](https://twitter.com/en/privacy); [https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy). Specific information about the information and images fetched for each brand may be found at [https://nsi.guide/](https://nsi.guide/). If you do not wish to interact with these third parties, you can deselect this feature in the User Preferences -> Privacy section.
